# Mini Dictionary CLI

A simple Python project I built to practice what Iâ€™ve learned.  
This CLI tool lets you:
- Translate words
- Translate sentences
- Take quick vocabulary quizzes

Data is stored in a JSON file (`data.json`) for easy management.  
Mainly a self-learning project, for fun and portfolio showcase.

## Installation & Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Khanshs/py-dictionary-CLI.git
cd py-dictionary-CLI
python main.py
